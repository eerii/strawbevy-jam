This is an example script.
It's intended to demonstrate a few of Yarn's features.
-> Like options!
    You just selected one, cool huh?
-> Like variables!
    Variables can be declared...
    <<declare $var to "foo">>
    And then interpolated...
    {$var} is the value of $var.
-> Like commands!
    Commands signal to your game engine that you want something to happen.
    <<play "mySickAnimation">>
    There are also some built in commands, like 'jump'...
    <<jump JumpTarget>>
Text after an option set will be displayed in all cases, unless there's a jump in one of the branches.

Which takes you to a different node!
And 'stop', which ends the dialogue.
<<stop>>
So this will never display!
