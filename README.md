# working title üå∏

(working title) is a conversation between two friends that haven't seen eachother for two years.
join remie and nico as they discover what has changed, in a cards-against-humanity meets interactive novel game.

choose your words carefully, since they can have unexpected side effects.
your can only play each card once, so it may be wise to reserve them for later!
watch as the mood of the encounter shifts with every action you take.

content warnings: in some of the conversations there are depictions of
transphobia, missgender and deadnaming, always as a result of the player's actions.
there is also a non explicit mention of suicidal thoughts.
please take care when playing and while we tried to cover this topics the best we could,
it is completely ok if you need to stop at any point.

by your fellow enbies, josekoalas and miguel l√≥pez gol√°n.
